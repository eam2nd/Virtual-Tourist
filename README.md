# Virtual Tourist

The Virtual Tourist app allows users to place markers on a map and when a marker is tapped it will load random photos from Flickr based on the marker's location. This project was part of the persistence section of Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree.

Virtual Tourist is the fifth project in the iOS Developer Nanodegree in Udacity.

## To Build/Run:


**You will need to insert your Flickr API Key into:**
&lt;project-root&gt;/Virtual Tourist/API/Extensions/FlickrClient+Constants.swift


```swift
static let apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
```


Replace **YOUR-API-KEY-HERE** with your Flickr API Key.
